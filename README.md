Cycle Sense
Cycle Sense is a voice-controlled menstrual cycle tracking app designed for visually impaired women. Powered by AI, it predicts cycles, ovulation, and fertility windows, offering voice-activated symptom logging, personalized insights, community wellness tips, and secure local storage (with planned Supabase integration). The app ensures accessibility with voice-guided navigation, audio reminders, and WCAG-compliant design.
